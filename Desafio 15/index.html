               transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up <br>
               for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
               The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
               the course, I‚Äôve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

                 <p class="before">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from
                    professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former
                    student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff
                    did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team
                    project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial
                    could ever have. In <br> fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent
                    experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack  <br>developer after receiving multiple <br> offers.
                    100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>

            <p class="was">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program
               gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a capable
               junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
